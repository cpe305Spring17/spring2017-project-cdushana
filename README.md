# Telos - A Goal Tracker
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cpe305Spring17/spring2017-project-cdushana.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cpe305Spring17/spring2017-project-cdushana)

This application is focused on building customizable goals throughout a personâ€™s daily lifestyle. A user will specify a goal and the date they want this goal to be completed by. The app will send routine notifications alerting the user to rate their success on completing their goal for that day.

## Installation

On your android device, simply search for Telos on the Google Play Store and download it.
  		  
## Implemented Features
- Ability to create and delete goals
- Customizable input for goals
- Multiple different activities/view for application
- Confirmation of completed goal
- Daily Notifications for all created goals

## Architecture Diagram
This application was made using the Model-View-Controller Architecture Pattern. Telos saves your data to the local storage on your Android device.
