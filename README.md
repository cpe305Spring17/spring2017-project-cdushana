[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cpe305Spring17/spring2017-project-cdushana.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cpe305Spring17/spring2017-project-cdushana)

This application is focused on building customizable goals throughout a personâ€™s daily lifestyle. A user will specify a goal and the date they want this goal to be completed by. The app will send routine notifications alerting the user to rate their success on completing their goal for that day.

## Design Patterns
- Single Pattern: used to retrive Calendar instances. Singleton is useful to quickly and easily recieve an instance of a class.
- Adapter Pattern: RecyclerView/RecycleAdapter for list of goals on main activity. 

## Screenshots

After downloading Telos, you will be presented with an empty homepage.

This Toast feature is activated when the user gently taps on any of the goals on the home screen. This Toast notifies the user of more functionality needed to access information.

You will recieved daily notifications for each goal that you create based on the time you have set. In this particular demo, I have the notification time set to the time the goal that was created. This will be changed in a later release.
